      <p1>It's really easy! We don't have any database and don't save your data. Your profile is only online for 30 min max. All you have to do is 1) sign up, 2) spend a free allotment of 100 Charm Coins at any attributes your date should have, 3) then answer some questions about yourself and you are done. We give you and your match eachother's email. Then you can email eachother to set up the date for tonight. </p1>
    <p1> Do you know that our match is the best way to match you for the first encounter? Than let your instinct guide you. Just date safely! Use an email account which you open only for Express Date. Don't give any private information. Meet in a public place. Just...you know...be safe and have fun. As always, date at your own risk. This application is not written for actual dating services, but was written as a requirement for a programming excercise. Most of all, be polite and respectfull with your date. </p1>

              <p1> As new users constantly join and leave, press the "search your date" button again to run an updated search. To start a relationship the most important thing is that you and your date have fun. This means you both most be in the mood to do the same thing today. As moods change and can't be planned in advance, we only allow dates which start within 3 hours after sign up. For the same reason we also allow your current profile to exsist for only a half an hour. </p1>
